		<h1>Biography</h1>
			
			<h2></h2>
		
			<p>I have not always been interested in Web Development. My vocational journey can be described topically.</p>
			
			<p>When I was six or so, I saw Free Willy in theaters. That began, I believe, my interest in Marine Biology.<br> 
			   My favorite animal became, if it was not already, orcinus orca, also known as the killer whale. I would express<br> 
  			   this fascination and appreciation by drawing pictures, basing a school project on the animal, and pursuing Biology<br>  
			   over the other sciences. It was only in High School that I began to look into the practical implications of a career in<br> 
			   marine biology. Due to my interest in orcas, I looked into an occupation that would allow me to work with them: a marine<br>  
			   mammal trainer at SeaWorld. My interest in that occupation quickly waned when I read that the average salary for that position<br> 
			   was around $36,000.00.</p>
			   
			   
			<p>Somewhat disillusioned with the idea of Marine Biology, but still interested in Biology in general., I declared a Biology major to avoid<br>
			   a rumored general education default courseload. This served me well until I hit the wall in Chemistry, which I took 3 times, and pre-Calculus,<br>
 			   which I underperformed in. I switched majors to Political Science and graduated with a B.A. After an internship in state-legislature, I had little<br>
			   to no interest in Political Science, I applied to one degree-relevant position before looking for any job that I could get. I worked briefly for a<br>
			   credit-card processing company and later for a similar period in the field of Mental Health.</p>

			<p>In childhood and early adolescence, I was an avid reader. Reading was a major source of the fiction I consumed while growing up. This likely prepared me<br>
    		   for an interest in theater. I started by participating in school and church productions. Upon entering high school, I chose Choir as my fine arts credit<br>
			   which gave me the opportunity to participate in show choir numbers and a few musicals. At one point, I did land a role in the drama department’s production<br>
			   of ‘You Can’t Take it With You’ as the IRS agent. At Middle Tennessee State University, I would be cast in ‘Pirates of Penzance’ at an off-campus black box theater.<br>
			   Eventually, after some years, I did dip my feet in Atlanta’s film and acting scene. This is where I was able to observe someone with real drive pursuing a career in Film<br>
			   and Television. This is when I was able to decide that I was not willing to work three jobs between acting classes and auditions. A mutual friend helped land me the job of<br>
			   Order Management Specialist. It was there that I worked until deciding to pursue a Computer Science degree at Concordia University in Seward, Nebraska.</p>
